    <p><strong>What did I learn? What is the &quot;big idea&quot;?</strong> I learned how to use the basics of turtle to draw shapes.</p>

    <p><strong>What challenges did I encounter?</strong> I did not encounter any challeges in this lesson.</p>

    <p><strong>How could this experience be improved?</strong> This is experience was pretty good as is. </p>

    <p><strong>Free Reflection: How has what I have learned affected my thinking?</strong> This helped me better understand why all functionality should be throughly understood before we use our intuition to predict what it will do.  </p>
