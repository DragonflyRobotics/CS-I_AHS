    <p><strong>Technical challenges --></strong> I am currently trying to understand how to render moving objects using IGIS and Swift which will be used for the ISP project. I understand how to render static objects but I don't fully understand the purpose of all the files in the template project.</p>
    <p><strong>Scheduling challenges --></strong> One of my team members has a job and another has classes to attend. This will add complications to scheduling since I have 4 clubs to attend and a research company I run.</p>
    <p><strong>Interpersonal challenges --></strong> We gave no encountered any interpersonal challenges yet. I think our biggest challenge at the momement is just ice-breaking and understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each person. </p>
