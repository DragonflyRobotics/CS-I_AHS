    <p><strong>1.1 What do you observe? --></strong> A black arc was drawn in the middle of the screen.</p>
    <p><strong>1.2 What is the purpose of the parameters <code>startAngle</code> and <code>endAngle</code>? --></strong> The <code>startAngle</code> and <code>endAngle</code> parameters help define what angle the arc starts at and stops at. </p>
    <p><strong>1.3 In which direction do you think the arc is being drawn (clockwise or counterclockwise)? --></strong> Clockwise since the end angle is greater than the start angle. </p>
    <p><strong>1.4 How can you test your hypothesis? --></strong> I can make the end angle smaller and see if it inverts the arc. </p>

    <p><strong>2.1 What do you observe? --></strong> A second arc formed that completes the previous one.</p>
    <p><strong>2.2 Note that there is only a single canvas.render() statement. How does this single statement result in the rendering of two arcs? --></strong> We appended a second arc to the same path object.</p>
    
    <p><strong>3.1 What do you observe? --></strong> The shaped was filled with a white-like color and the line thickness got significantly thicker. </p>
    <p><strong>3.2 Which line number determines whether or not this Path is filled? --></strong> Line number 2 determines whether the shape should be filled or not.</p>
    <p><strong>3.3 What do you observe? --></strong> A black arc was drawn in the middle of the screen.</p>

    <p><strong>4.1 What do you observe? --></strong> In addition to the previous arc, a new circle forme in the center of the previous one with a blue fill color.</p>
    <p><strong>4.2 The outerPath contains two arcs and each specifies a startAngle and endAngle. These angles aren't specified explicitly for the innerPath. What are the default angles in this case? --></strong> The default angles are likely 0 and PI since that would define a circle. </p>

    <p><strong>5.1 What do you observe? --></strong> Now there are lines on the upper part of the arc of the eye.</p>
    <p><strong>5.2 Is a path necessarily constructed of a single, continuous line? --></strong> They do not have to be continuous and can be detached lines. </p>

    <p><strong>What did I learn? What is the &quot;big idea&quot;?</strong> I learned how to draw polygons using the line tool and make circles and ellipses to add more unique shapes to my designs.</p>

    <p><strong>What challenges did I encounter?</strong> I did not encounter any challeges in this lesson.</p>

    <p><strong>How could this experience be improved?</strong> This is experience was pretty good as is. </p>

    <p><strong>Free Reflection: How has what I have learned affected my thinking?</strong> This lesson helped me learn different properties I could change and use in IGIS. I learned how to join lines back to back and use StrokeStyle properly to ensure that only certain shapes are colored a certain color. </p>
