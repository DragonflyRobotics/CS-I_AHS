    <p><strong>1.1 What do you observe? --></strong> There is a blue rectangle in the upper half of the screen.</p>
    <p><strong>1.2 Is the rectangle wider than it is tall or taller than it is wide? Why? --></strong> The rectangle is taller than it is wider because in the code, we set the hight to 300 but the width to only 200.</p>
    <p><strong>1.3 Is the rectangle filled or only an outline? Why? --></strong> The rectangle is filled because we have a line that says the fillStyle is FillStyle with the color blue instead of stroke. </p>
    <p><strong>1.4 What color is the rectangle? Why is it that specific shade rather than a similar color? --></strong> It is a bright blue color. It isn't any other shade of blue since the .blue tag is defined as RGB(0, 0, 255).</p>

    <p><strong>2.1 What do you observe? --></strong> The rectangle has a green border and is hallow in the middle. </p>
    <p><strong>2.2 Is the rectangle filled or only an outline? Why? --></strong> The rectangle is now an outline since we set the fillStyle to StrokeStyle which only shows the stroke and not the fill. </p>
    <p><strong>2.3 What color is the rectangle? Why is it that specific shade rather than a similar color? --></strong> The rectangle's outline is a green color. It is only that shade of green since the .green tag used is defined to be RGB(0, 255, 0)</p>

    <p><strong>3.1 What do you observe? --></strong> The rectangle has a green border and is hallow in the middle. But now, the border is thicker.</p>
    <p><strong>3.2 How has the appearance of the rectangle changed from the previous section? Why? --></strong> The border is significantly thicker since we set the line width to 5.</p>

    <p><strong>4.1 What do you observe? --></strong> There is a green rectangle that is longer than it is wider and the border is a thick blue border. </p>
    <p><strong>4.2 How has the appearance of the rectangle changed from the previous section? Why? --></strong> The rectangle now has a green center and a thick blue border. </p>

    <p><strong>What did I learn? What is the &quot;big idea&quot;?</strong> I learned how to modify the different properties of Objects to change color, line thickness, etc. </p>

    <p><strong>What challenges did I encounter?</strong> I did not encounter any challeges in this lesson.</p>

    <p><strong>How could this experience be improved?</strong> This is experience was pretty good as is. </p>

    <p><strong>Free Reflection: How has what I have learned affected my thinking?</strong> This lesson helped me learn different properties I could changed and has helped me learn how to use a transparent rectangle with only a stroke in my ISP project. </p>
