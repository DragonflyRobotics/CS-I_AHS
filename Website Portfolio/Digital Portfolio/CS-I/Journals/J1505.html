    <p><strong>1.1 What do you think it means for an Image to be "ready"? --></strong> It means that the image is laoded on the server and ready to render.</p>
    <p><strong>1.2 Why didn't we need to wait for a Path or an Ellipse to be ready? --></strong> Since those aren't being loaded from an external source and are being computed on the spot, they don't need to be ready.</p>
    
    <p><strong>2.1 What do you observe? --></strong> There is a picture of the whitehouse.</p>
    <p><strong>2.2 What do you think determines the location of the image? --></strong> Nothing so it is simply centeredon the screen.</p>
    <p><strong>2.3 What do you think determines the size of the image? --></strong> Nothing so it defaults to the original size of the image.</p>

    <p><strong>3.1 What do you observe? --></strong> The image shifted to the top left corner.</p>

    <p><strong>4.1 What do you observe? --></strong> </p>
    <p><strong>4.2 What happens if the sourceRect is smaller than the destinationRect? --></strong> The image is stretched or enlarged.</p>
    <p><strong>4.3 What happens if the sourceRect is larger than the destinationRect? --></strong> The image is shrunken or reduced in size. </p>

    <p><strong>What did I learn? What is the &quot;big idea&quot;?</strong> I learned how to use images and modify their shape and location to suit my purpose.</p>

    <p><strong>What challenges did I encounter?</strong> I did not encounter any challeges in this lesson.</p>

    <p><strong>How could this experience be improved?</strong> This is experience was pretty good as is. </p>

    <p><strong>Free Reflection: How has what I have learned affected my thinking?</strong> This lesson helped me better understand the concept of defaulting and how it can be used to create failsafe code.  </p>
