1.1 --> "git log" shows the latest commit hash along with some other useful info like the commit date, commit message, etc.
1.2 --> The command "git commit" and "git log" both show the commit message.
1.3 --> This is because they show you the commit info.

2.1 --> file2.txt is red and it is asking to start tracking the file while it is asking to stage file1.txt.
2.2 --> No, file2.txt is not added to git while one is added but not staged.

3.1 --> The 2 files are now under the same section and one has the modified status while the other has the new file status.
3.2 --> They are both green and ready to commit but have a different status.

4.1 --> 2 files have been listed with changes.
4.2 --> The specific line changes are all the text I added like "New line" and "This is another sentence". Green means added and red means deleted.

What did I learn? What is the "big idea"? I learned about source control and how it works. I learned about it's potential uses and its inventor. Source control is a method of managing different versions of a project. It allows you to see the change history and revert back incase something goes wrong. 

What challenges did I encounter? I didn't encounter any errors yet since I have prior experience with Github and Git CLI.

How could this experience be improved? I think my experience is perfect so far.

Free Reflection: How has what I have learned affected my thinking? I have learned about some new commands like "git log" and "git diff --cached" that will make my workflow more efficient. I am also able to think about Github Flow in a new way.
