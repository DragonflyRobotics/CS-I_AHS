1.1 --> It prints "Outside of Merlin"

2.1 --> It prints "Merlin root"
2.2 --> It provides info about the status of different missions along with the due date, eligible, and accepted date, etc.

3.1 --> It added some files and folders as a starters documents for Merlin Missions. 
3.2 --> It prepared the folder for missions. It added all the available missions as folders to navigate into.

4.1 --> It added a bunch of files for that given challenge and it contained instructions on how to do the assignment.
4.2 --> It basically figures out if you are in a challenge folder, mission folder, or root folder, and appropriately sets up the files. If you are in the challenge folder, it will add the challenge files like instructions.txt and questions.txt, but it won't do that in the merlin root directory or the mission directory.  

What did I learn? What is the "big idea"? I learned how to use the Merlin Missions using the "merlin" folder and the "merlin" command.

What challenges did I encounter? I have no issues.

How could this experience be improved? I can't think of any ways this can be better. This mission system is pretty cool!

Free Reflection: How has what I have learned affected my thinking? I have learned to check this tool for any missions and learned to use the Merlin Missions tool. This wiki was short and it didn't significantly affect my thinking. I did learn how to properly use the merlin mission manager to complete assignments and learn from my mistakes.
