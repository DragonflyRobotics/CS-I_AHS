    <p><strong>What did I learn? What is the &quot;big idea&quot;?</strong> The big idea is developing certain logic gates using other gate limitations. I learned how to use cannonical representation and De Morgan's Law to create any logic gate system given a truth table.</p>

    <p><strong>What challenges did I encounter?</strong> The biggest challenge for me was the editor itself. It didn't allow me to bend the wires and among other editor limitations made it hard to make the more complicated logic compositions.</p>

    <p><strong>How could this experience be improved?</strong> I am not sure. Maybe we can use a better editor like Fritzing or something similar that allows for more control. However Fritzing does on do the simulation that this tool does.</p>

    <p><strong>Free Reflection: How has what I have learned affected my thinking?</strong> I have learned how to approach logic composition problems and how to best used different strategies to solve them.</p>
