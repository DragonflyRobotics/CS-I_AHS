    <p><strong>What did I learn? What is the &quot;big idea&quot;?</strong> I learned how addition works through the use of full and half adders to make a ripple carry adder.</p>

    <p><strong>What challenges did I encounter?</strong> I did not encounter any challenges yet.</p>

    <p><strong>How could this experience be improved?</strong> I think, so far my experience is perfect.</p>

    <p><strong>Free Reflection: How has what I have learned affected my thinking?</strong> I understand how to make the mathematical concept of addition more solid through the use of logic composition.</p>
