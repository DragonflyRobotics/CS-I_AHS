    <p><strong>1.1 Compare this behavior to that of the while loop. What are the similarities? What are the differences? --></strong> They both use a conditional to evaluate the status of the loop and decides whether to exit the loop or continue looping through the body. But, repeat-while loops run the body atleast once no matter the condition. Then the condition is evaluated. In while loops, the condition is evaluated first and then the body is executed if the condition is true. </p>
    <p><strong>1.2 What are the minimum number of times that this loop will execute? --></strong> 1</p>
    <p><strong>1.3 What is the purpose of the Jump instruction after the consequent? --></strong> It is meant to go back to the body to loop and then evaluate its state. </p>
    <p><strong>2.1 Are you able to implement the same functionality found in a while loop using a repeat-while loop, without changing the condition or adding a conditional? Explain and provide an example. --></strong> No, you would have to add an additional conditional to make a while loop using a repeat while loop.</p>
    <p><strong>2.2 Are you able to implement the same functionality found in a repeat-while loop using a while loop, without changing the condition or adding a conditional? Explain and provide an example. --></strong> Yes, you can simply add a copy of the statement before the while loop which makes it run atleast once. Then the condition is evaluated and the rest of the body is executed accordingly. For example:
      <pre>
	var out = true
	out = body_function()
	while out == true {
	    out = body_function()
	}
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p><strong>What did I learn? What is the &quot;big idea&quot;?</strong> I learned the difference between a while and repeat while loop and their representation in a diagram and in assembly.</p>

    <p><strong>What challenges did I encounter?</strong> I did not encounter any challeges in this lesson.</p>

    <p><strong>How could this experience be improved?</strong> This is experience was pretty good as is. </p>

    <p><strong>Free Reflection: How has what I have learned affected my thinking?</strong> This lesson gave me a new perspective of while and repeat-while loops. When looking at repeat-while loops, I can better understand how they function since I know how to make them in assembly. </p>
