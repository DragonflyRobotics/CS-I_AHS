    <p><strong>Technical challenges --></strong> I am currently trying to understand how to render moving objects using IGIS and Swift which will be used for the ISP project. I understand how to render static objects but I don't fully understand the purpose of all the files in the template project.</p>
    <p><strong>Scheduling challenges --></strong> One of my team members has a job and another has classes to attend. This will add complications to scheduling since I have 4 clubs to attend and a research company I run.</p>
    <p><strong>Interpersonal challenges --></strong> We gave no encountered any interpersonal challenges yet. I think our biggest challenge at the momement is just ice-breaking and understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each person. </p>

    <h3>Role Assignments this Week:</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>(Software) Development Engineer - </strong>Omer Sonmez
	<ul>
	  <li>A software developer is primarily in charge of writing code and implementing new features. I have been programming for 6.5 years and know numerous programming languages. I also have experience with professional CS and engineering experience in the workforce. I think I would do great because I have the skillset and the exprience this job requires. One potential challenge is the fact that I have no experience in Swift. I will need to gain some experience in this field before I can do well in this position.</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>QA Engineer - </strong>Michael Asemota
	<ul>
	  <li>A QA engineer is meant to test new features and improve them. The ensure the product is as professional as possible. Due to my deep knowlege of the innerworkings of the program and my prior experience, I can quickly find and attack potential vunerabilities in the program and ensure it doesn't glitch or break. Traceback in Swift is difficult because of the way it was made and the way IGIS works so I may not be able to quckly find the root of the problem. I will research into potential tools or debug tracers that will simplify the debugging experience and find the root of the errors quicker. </li>
	</ul>
      </li>  
      <li><strong>Project Manager - </strong>Krishna Shah
	<ul>
	  <li>The project manager ensures that all parts of the project including the journals, documentation, and testing (along with the product) are on track. They ensure that everyone is on task. I would be a good fit for this position because I have a lot of leadership experience. I run my own research company and have lead many teams in the past. One problem I might encounter is the fact that I barely know anyone on my team. It is easier to lead a team I am familiar with. I will hold ice-breaking sessions to know the team a little better.</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Product Manager - </strong>Zaref Farhaan
	<ul>
	  <li>The product manager is similar to the project manager but manages just the product. I would be a good fit for this position because I have a lot of leadership experience. I run my own research company and have lead many teams in the past. Plus, since this is a more technical field, I will be able to provide more input. One problem I might encounter is the fact that I barely know anyone on my team. It is easier to lead a team I am familiar with. I will hold ice-breaking sessions to know the team a little better. </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Release Engineer (optional) - </strong>N/A
	<ul>
	  <li>This role works on the Journals and documentation. They ensure that all progress is documented and reported. They also ensure that the final product is professional and viable in the market. I would be a good fit because I can write well and I manage my time well. I also know the inner workings of the game really well so I can write more detailed Journals. I have never made a project that release publicly so I don't have any experience with making a project look professional and production-ready. I will research into professional CS projects to see how they are manages and released. </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
