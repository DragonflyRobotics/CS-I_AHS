    <p><strong>1.1  Take careful note of how the colors are selected in turn. What prevents us from running off the right edge of the array? --></strong> The last line is responsible for ensuring that the index is reset after the last element is reached via the modulo operator.</p>
    <p><strong>2.1  What do you predict will happen? --></strong> It will create a bunch of squares in rotating orientations.</p>
    <p><strong>2.2  Before proceeding, draw your hypothesis on graph paper.  --></strong> I drew it (xD)</p>
    <p><strong>3.1  Was your hypothesis correct? If not, why not? --></strong> Yes, it was correct</p>

    <p><strong>What did I learn? What is the &quot;big idea&quot;?</strong> I learned how to make repetive geometric shapes using turtle.</p>

    <p><strong>What challenges did I encounter?</strong> I did not encounter any challeges in this lesson.</p>

    <p><strong>How could this experience be improved?</strong> This is experience was pretty good as is. </p>

    <p><strong>Free Reflection: How has what I have learned affected my thinking?</strong> I learned to use the modulo operator to iterate over a array more times than its size.  </p>
