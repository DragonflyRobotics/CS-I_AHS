    <p><strong>1.1 If you're outside of the Merlin directory and attempt a  Merlin Mission Manager  command, what is printed for your "Current location"? --&gt;</strong> It prints &quot;Outside of Merlin&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>2.1 If you're inside of the Merlin directory and attempt a  Merlin Mission Manager  command, what is printed for your "Current location"? --&gt;&nbsp;</strong>It prints &quot;Merlin root&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>2.2 Based on the output of the above command, what information does the  Merlin Mission Manager  provide to you? --&gt;</strong> It provides info about the status of different missions along with the due date, eligible, and accepted date, etc.</p>
    <p><strong>3.1 Look at the directory listing before and after you issued the "merlin prepare" command. What's changed? --&gt;</strong> It added some files and folders as a starters documents for Merlin Missions.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>3.2 What do you think the purpose of the "prepare" command is? --&gt;</strong> It prepared the folder for missions. It added all the available missions as folders to navigate into.</p>
    <p><strong>4.1 What changed in this directory after you issued the prepare command? --&gt;</strong> It added a bunch of files for that given challenge and it contained instructions on how to do the assignment.</p>
    <p><strong>4.2 What is the purpose of the prepare command and how does its role differ depending on context? --&gt;</strong> It basically figures out if you are in a challenge folder, mission folder, or root folder, and appropriately sets up the files. If you are in the challenge folder, it will add the challenge files like instructions.txt and questions.txt, but it won&apos;t do that in the merlin root directory or the mission directory. &nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>What did I learn? What is the &quot;big idea&quot;?</strong> I learned how to use the Merlin Missions using the &quot;merlin&quot; folder and the &quot;merlin&quot; command.</p>
    <p><strong>What challenges did I encounter?</strong> I have no issues.</p>
    <p><strong>How could this experience be improved?</strong> I can&apos;t think of any ways this can be better. This mission system is pretty cool!</p>
    <p><strong>Free Reflection: How has what I have learned affected my thinking?</strong> I have learned to check this tool for any missions and learned to use the Merlin Missions tool. This wiki was short and it didn&apos;t significantly affect my thinking. I did learn how to properly use the merlin mission manager to complete assignments and learn from my mistakes.</p>
