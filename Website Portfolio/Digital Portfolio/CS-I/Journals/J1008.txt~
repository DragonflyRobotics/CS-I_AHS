1.1 --> It prints "Outside of Merlin"

2.1 --> It prints "Merlin root"
2.2 --> It provides info about the status of different missions along with the due date, eligible, and accepted date, etc.

3.1 --> It added some files and folders as a starters documents for Merlin Missions.
3.2 --> It prepared the folder for missions.

What did I learn? What is the "big idea"? I learned how to use the Merlin Missions using the "merlin" folder and the "merlin" command.

What challenges did I encounter? I haven't done a Merlin Mission yet, so I have no issues.

How could this experience be improved? I can't think of any ways this can be better. This mission system is pretty cool!

Free Reflection: How has what I have learned affected my thinking? I have learned to check this tool for any missions and learned to use the Merlin Missions tool. This wiki was short and it didn't significantly affect my thinking.
